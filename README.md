# odin_calculator

Loop through operators and add event listeners that change
operator variable to said operators value.
check if there is a number in first number before allowing operator to be selected.


BUGS TO FIX

# Only the first number can use decimals
 -> if storedNumber is not 0 check after operator for a decimal.

# Number 0 can still be typed after operator is set
